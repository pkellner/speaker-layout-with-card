Using messages as the communication mechanism among different services allows more independence of the individual components that make up a larger system, thus enabling faster development, faster deployment, and additional scalability.  Introducing Persistent Messages further enhances the architecture to allow time independence as well.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the overall structure of an Event Driven Architecture, discuss the business and technical advantages, and review how to migrate an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture.  Brad will present his experiences in migrating an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture, talk about lessons learned along the way.\n\nIf you have a large legacy application you need to break into microservices, or you are involved in a Domain Driven Design project, this talk is for you.\n",

When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know the contributions to which managers need to apply themselves. Worse, their larger organizations often lay down expectations for them that are incompatible with agile. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nAgile has shifted the old roles and responsibilities. A manager bent on command-and-control is clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are unclear on the contribution they must make will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nRon Lichty echoes many of the early agile thought leaders: managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both in transitioning to agile and in agile itself. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThis session is about managers’ critical contributions, and is for managers, for prospective managers, for team leads, and for members of teams thinking through how to make their teams the best teams they’ve ever been part of.",

While running one Redis in one container is limiting, it can be very useful. But deploying Redis in a cluster of containers can give you scale and reliability your startup needs. In fact, some companies run 100's of instances of Redis as their primary database. In this talk, I'll share 5 popular use cases for Redis in Containers, Kubernetes and even Serverless. And I'll show you how to package Redis for deployment via Docker \u0026 Kubernetes. If I'm feeling gutsy, I might even show you how to run Redis on Windows.",

Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",

Eventually, the application will become extremely large and the organization ends up in monolithic hell. All aspects of development, testing and deployment are slow and painful. It’s impossible for the developers to keep up with the demands of the business. And, to make matters worse the application uses a technology stack that is increasingly obsolete.\n\nThe way to escape monolithic hell is to migrate to the microservice architecture. In this talk, you will learn about the essential characteristics of microservices. I describe the benefits and drawbacks  of the microservice architecture and when it makes sense to use it. You will learn about the design problems you will encounter when using microservices. I describe how to solve this problems by applying the microservices pattern language. You will learn how the microservice architecture accelerates the delivery of large, complex applications.\n",

We will differentiate between machine learning and the sub-field of deep learning, and pursue a more intuitive understanding of how deep learning is implemented. Primarily, we will explore neural networks and their most common architectures, focusing on the deep neural networks that are most effectively used with visual data such as image recognition (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks), and those most amenable to sequential data like natural language processing (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks). The aim is for attendees to become conversant with deep learning and to acquire a clearer understanding of the concept as well as its application.",
